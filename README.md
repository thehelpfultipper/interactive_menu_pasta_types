# Interactive Menu - Learn Your Pasta :yum:

**Blog Post:** [How To Build An Interactive Menu Component](https://thehelpfultipper.com/how-to-build-an-interactive-menu-component/).

Find a detailed walkthrough in the blog post on The Helpful Tipper blog (^_^)

**Objective:**

Create an interactive menu component that can be customized for any type of website.

The main objective is to have a list of various pasta kinds that, when a user hovers over each, a background picture of that pasta type will display. As the mouse moves to another pasta name, a seamless transition will bring up its corresponding picture as background.
